        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Srishti Kumari, currently exploring different areas in tech to understand what I enjoy working on the most. I try to learn by doing—building simple projects and improving step by step. This portfolio is a small reflection of the things I'm working on as I continue learning and figuring things out at my own pace.</p>
        <p>I built this portfolio to document my learning journey and showcase my projects as I grow.</p>
